Unattended leads report
=======================

*Unattended leads* are leads that have scheduled activities that are either due or past due.
Whenever an activity is scheduled, *Odoo* tracks the due date and sends email reminders to the users
the activity is assigned to.

An *unattended leads report* compiles all active leads in the pipeline with due or past due
activities, allowing a sales manager to identify which opportunities require immediate attention.

By pulling a daily unattended leads report, sales managers can remind their teams to address
outstanding activities before they become past due, helping avoid neglected leads and reinforcing
proactive behaviors in their salespeople.

.. example::

   A sales manager starts their day by pulling an unattended leads report, and upon switching to
   list view, they see the following:

   .. image:: unattended_leads_report/unattended-leads-example.png
      :align: center
      :alt: List view of a sample Unattended Leads report with the activities emphasized.

  Their team member, Mitchell, has two leads in the Proposition stage with activities that are due.
  The yellow :guilabel:`üìû (phone)` icon indicates that the `5 VP Chairs` lead has a phone call
  activity scheduled for today. The red :guilabel:`‚úâÔ∏è (envelope)` icon indicates that the `Modern
  Open Space` lead has an email activity scheduled that is past due.

  Clicking on the `Modern Open Space` lead, the sales manager opens the record of the lead and
  reviews the chatter. They see that the email was scheduled to be sent two days ago, but Mitchell
  never marked this activity as done.

.. important::
   In order to pull an unattended leads report, activity track **must** be utilized in the *CRM*
   pipeline.

   :guilabel:`all` is selected in this field.

Activity tracking
=================

:doc:`Activities </applications/productivity/discuss/overview/plan_activities>` are follow-up tasks
tied to a record in the database. Activities can be scheduled on any page of the database that
contains a chatter thread, Kanban view, list view, or activities view of an application.

A best practice for pipeline management is scheduling activities or marking them as *done* anytime a
lead is interacted with. Ensuring that all members of the sales team properly schedule and follow up
on activities allows the *Pipeline Analysis* to pull useful and actionable metrics.

.. tip::
   Activity colors, and their relation to an activity's due date, are consistent throughout the
   database, regardless of the activity type, or the view.

    - *Green* indicates that the due date is in the future.
    - *Yellow* indicates that the due date is today.
    - *Red* indicates that the due date has passed.
